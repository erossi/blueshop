This is the rsync manual way to install the blueshop site under a destination server on the /usr/local directory.
Run the command from the main blueshop directory.

to Test what's going on:

rsync -cnrlvz --delete --delete-excluded --exclude-from doc/rsync_exclude_file.txt --whole-file ./ <remote_user@remote_server>:/usr/local/share/blueshop/

to do It, simply remove the 'n' switch from the rsync command (-crlv).
